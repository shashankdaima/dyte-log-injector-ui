        1. Lack of time, this assignment feels like a week of work.
        2. Constraints of using free resources like rabbitmq shared queue blocks some traffic and supabase will pause the db if it not being used for over a week something. 
        3. I messed very very much :(, i started with rust apis, because I thought it would be more efficient on runtime. Plus, I could not able to do use rabbitmq for 7-8 hours. It was a exploration of redis, rabbitmq, streamlit(frontend is built with streamlit). Resulting in only online mode.
